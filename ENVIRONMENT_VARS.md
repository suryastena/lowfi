# Environment Variables

Lowfi has some more specific options, usually as a result of minor feature requests, which are only documented here.
If you have some behaviour you'd like to change, which is quite specific, then see if one of these options suits you.

* `LOWFI_FIXED_MPRIS_NAME` - Limits the number of lowfi instances to one, but ensures the player name is always `lowfi`.
